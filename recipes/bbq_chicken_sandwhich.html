    <h2>Barbecue sauce, shredded chicken, and a toasty bun piled high with crunchy slaw!</h2>
    <p>I’m always excited for summer grilling. This summer, there will be WAY fewer BBQ blowout parties at my house, but I’ll still be using the grill to fire up easy family recipes like these Grilled BBQ Chicken Sandwiches!</p>
    <p>These sandwiches have a nice tang to them thanks to a homemade BBQ sauce (but you can use store-bought as well) and a pickle slaw, which is just my favorite. Will my kids eat these sandwiches though?! Read the report card below to find out!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 green cabbage, thin shredded (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, grated (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped dill pickles</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 - 1 1/2 cups Hank’s Kansas City BBQ Sauce or store-bought</li>
        <li>8 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Make the slaw - Whisk together mayo, pickle juice, and sugar. Stir in shredded cabbage, carrots, and pickles. Stir together and taste. Season to your liking. Slaw can be made a day or two in advance with no problem.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Heat the grill and prepare the chicken - Preheat grill to medium-high heat. To butterfly the chicken, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken horizontally – leaving the edge connected so you can open the chicken breast – making it thinner and therefore faster-cooking. Then drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce into a bowl and set it aside. You will add it to the cooked chicken later.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Grill the chicken and chiles (if using) - Add chicken to grill and spoon BBQ sauce over each piece of chicken. You will use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce for this part of cooking. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. Flip and add BBQ sauce to the second side. Grill for another 5 to 6 minutes on the second side or until the chicken breasts reach 165 ̊F. Remove from the grill.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Shred the chicken - When chicken comes off the grill, let it cool briefly and then use two forks to shred or roughly chop the chicken. Stir the 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce you set aside in step 1 into the shredded chicken.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Make your sandwich - Toast your sandwich buns (if you want to) and smear with serrano mayo if you’re using it. Top with a heap of pickle slaw and shredded BBQ chicken. Serve with chips and pickles on the side.</li>
    </ol>
