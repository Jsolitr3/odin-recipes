Project to make a recipe website

This project will use all the skills learned from
the html portion of the foundations training. This
project should demonstrate my ability to create all
of the webpages needed to make a full site while using
various tags and elements. I should also demonstrate
the ability to use git correctly and comments to describe
changes and code.
